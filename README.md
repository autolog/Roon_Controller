# Overview

The Autolog Roon Controller is a plugin for version 7+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to control a Roon music player directly from Indigo.

The plugin uses a lightly modified version of the [Roon Python Library][2] created by Marcel van der Veldt and now also maintained by Greg Dowling.
